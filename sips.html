        <p>
          GB NetZero Cottages are affordable and produce as much clean energy as
          they consume. They are up to 90% more energy efficient than typical
          new homes and can use renewable energy systems to produce the
          remaining energy they need. Every part of a GB Cottage works together
          to provide consistent temperatures throughout, prevent drafts, and
          filter indoor air to reduce dust and allergens. The result:
          exceptional energy performance and the ultimate in comfort. It adds up
          to a better living experience.
        </p>

        <p class="quote wow bounceIn">exceptional value</p>

        <p>
          There is exceptional value in a NetZero GB Cottage because it's built
          to higher standards than other conventional new homes, a GB NetZero
          Cottage is more durable - with higher performance, warm windows and
          better insulated walls and roof. You will find with your investment in
          a GB NetZero Cottage, your utility bills will fall to an all-time low,
          and stay low all year round.
        </p>

        <p class="quote wow bounceIn">exceptional comfort</p>

        <p>
          A GB NetZero Cottage delivers exceptional comfort all year round in
          part because it is built with GB SIPS and the cooling, ventilation
          systems means more even temperatures throughout the cottage. A
          built-in filtered fresh air system reduces allergens and asthma
          triggers, such as dust, pollen and outdoor pollution.
        </p>

        <p class="quote wow bounceIn">quiet / silent</p>

        <img
          src="./images/sips/lawn-mower.jpg"
          style="float: left; width: 100px"
          alt=""
        />

        <p>
          Tightly built and well insulated, a GB NetZero Cottage is quiet even
          between floors because GB SIPS are used throughout including interior
          and exterior walls, floors and roof. Outside noise such as traffic,
          lawnmowers and barking dogs are virtually silenced.
        </p>

        <p class="quote wow bounceIn">built-in efficiency</p>

        <img
          src="./images/sips/solar-panels.jpg"
          style="float: right; width: 250px"
          alt=""
        />

        <p>
          People are more likely to spend the money on a NetZero home if it
          comes already built-in, rather than the extreme costs to make an
          existing home NetZero. GB NetZero Cottages also come with option of
          built-in solar roofs further maximizing energy consumption making it
          feasible to go off grid. In a GB NetZero Cottage, comfort and energy
          efficiency does not cost more because it comes built-in as a standard
          offering; You always get NetZero when you purchase a GB Cottage!
